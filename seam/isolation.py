"""Isolation mode: which machine state a run was measured under, and the rule against pooling.

Two prior runs differed by a factor of 1.98 with identical configuration. The difference was
machine state -- one measured with the desktop in use, one with it closed down. Nothing in the
manifest recorded that, so the difference was invisible to analysis and the ratio was
unexplainable rather than merely large.

This module makes that state a first-class recorded property:

``local``
    Measured with the machine in normal use. Development, smoke runs, anything untimed.

``remote``
    Measured in the mode of ``docs/SETUP_remote_measurement.md``: editor and browsers closed,
    driven over SSH, nobody touching the machine while the run is in flight.

Two protections follow from recording it.

**Declaration is mandatory and fails closed.** There is no default. A run that does not declare
its mode does not emit a manifest, because a defaulted mode is exactly the silent mislabel this
exists to prevent -- and it would be wrong in whichever direction the default was chosen.

**A declaration that contradicts the machine is refused.** Declaring ``remote`` while tier-1
operator-controlled software is resident is not a labelling slip, it is a claim about the
measurement that is false. Tier-1 processes are enumerated in the refusal so the operator knows
what to close. Tier-2 auto-respawning shell / vendor agents are recorded (in isolation evidence
and in every cell's ``environment_start`` / ``environment_peak``) but do not refuse: they return
within ~5 s of Stop-Process (verified 2026-08-09; hosts MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS and
MicrosoftWindows.Client.WebExperience). The Available-MBytes floor remains the substantive
memory gate and is unchanged.

:func:`assert_poolable` is the consumption-side half: analysis that spans modes is invalid
regardless of how clean each half looks on its own.
